About The GUI
We wished to design a simplistic but elegant application for our version of the Boggle game.
We added instructions to the initial message opened at the Boggle file opening, for two reasons:
- To make the game as clear as possible, while the rules are not intuitive to all.
- To make sure the players know the 03:00 minute countdown starts right after they click to start to start the game.
To Allow harmony of colors, we picked Red, Orange, light Blue, dark Green and light Green.
